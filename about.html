                Yemisrach is currently a sophomore software engineering student in Addis Ababa Institute of Technology.
                Though she may not be an expert, she loves taking photographs and likes anything to do with graphics.
                Whether it's the bustle of the city she lives in, the immaculate and fresh countryside, the people immersed in conversations, 
                the breathtaking hues of the sunset, or the artistic drawings in galleries she sees once in a while, 
                she captures every moment she can with her camera. 

            </p>

                Books are her passion. Most of the time she reads fiction genres 
                although she tries other genres now and then, which at times have not been successful. Despite the fact that she is articulate 
                in only two languages, Amharic and English, she is eager to master foreign languages such as French and Mandarin.
                And since her country has diverse people and rich history, she enjoys discovering (though only through TV and programs) their story, culture, food, and clothing. 
                Aside from all these, if the opportunity comes, she would want to travel starting from the lush land of Ethiopia and continuing to
                other parts of the world.
